# Identifying DNA methylation signatures in encapsulated follicular pattern thyroid tumors

#### What is EFPTTs?

**Encapsulated follicular-patterned thyroid tumors (EFPTTs)** are commonly encountered in pathological thyroid practice. They include benign (FA), borderline (NIFTP, WDT-UMP, FT-UMP), and malignant (IEFVPTC/fvPTC, FC) tumors.

#### The problem in diagnosis?

Pathologic diagnosis of these entities can be made based on the histologic examination of capsular/vascular
invasion and nuclear features of PTC. However, classifications of the numerous follicular-patterned neoplasms have received considerable attention due to high interobserver variability and demonstrated behavioral variation. Additionally, it also
shares similar genetic lesions with different prevalences but these findings are not high enough to consistently guide diagnosis. This study aims to develop a new molecular biology diagnostic approach based on DNA methylation for distinguishing the EFPTTs
group.

#### The results

The classification model distinguishing four subtypes including FA, NIFTP, FC and fvPTC in encapsulated follicular-patterned thyroid tumors (EFPTTs) was built successfully based on 13 CpGs with significantly different DNA methylation values among tumors and the RandomForest algorithm. This model was validated with two independent cohorts with positive results, thereby opening up opportunities for
applying this new diagnostic method in the future. Aberrant DNA methylation in EFPTTs groups also revealed the relevance between it and four pathways related tumor development and the immune system, which created a new approach to research and
treatment for thyroid tumor patients.
